INSTALL
=======

To build this casa_asap package:

1) ./configure.sh
2) Do this ONLY if you have non-standard locations for cfitsio or rpfits
   If RPFITS is not in /usr/local/
   
   edit  "linux/UNKNOWN_SITE/makedefs"
   or    "linux_64b/UNKNOWN_SITE/makedefs"
   or    "darwin/UNKNOWN_SITE/makedefs"
   
   and replace 
   
   RPFITSROOT := /usr/local
   
   with
   
   RPFITSROOT := myrpfitsdir
 
3) ./build.sh
4) patience ;-)


NOTES
=====

The OSX installation isn't straight forward. Please use the binary package 
instead.
